# highPerformanceCalculation_CUDA_ProteinStructureComparison
## 2 points for this research
* Algorithms for protein structure comparison
* Optimizations for original algorithm
## Goal of ProteinStructureComparison
Build 1 or more similiar 3D structure of 1 Protein based on its shape and 3-level structure
## Evaluation of comparison results
Test structure vs Standard structure. Through structure comparison algorithm, we obtain a set of atom coordinates & RMSD of the 2 structures. A translation vector **t** and rotation vector **u**. And by inverse translation and rotation, test protein will be compared to standard protein.
